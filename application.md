##### Google Summer of Code 2017
I was a participant in Google Summer of Code 2017 [1] with the OpenAstronomy organization. My project involved the design and development of a Python client for Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS) [2], which is a scheme for describing astronomical images, source catalogues, and three-dimensional data cubes to manage large volumes of heterogeneous data. The package [3] enabled users to view astronomical figures in an interactive environment. I also maintained an extensive blog [4] throughout this period.

During the tenure of three months, I acquired a deal of knowledge about software design principles and testing software from a user perspective. I wrote automated test cases and contiguously integrated code using Travis CI. Furthermore, I also composed API and user-level documentation using Sphinx [4].

##### Full-Stack Web Developer
Moreover, I have been a Full-Stack web developer for almost three years, and have worked on multitude of projects ranging for SaaS to e-commerce websites. I work remotely on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018e56b8591046f889) and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/adl1995). My clients are either IT organizations or independent contractors. Apart from web development, I also work on web automation and data scraping using ``Selenium`` and ``BeautifulSoup``. The skills that I acquire are through self learning and consistency. I believe ...

##### Open Source contributions
Apart from the hips repository [3], where I have been contributor till GSoC 2017, I have made small contributions to these projects: OpenCV [5], libLAS [6], Jailhouse [7], Jupyter notebook [8], and axios [9].

##### Relevant coursework
My interest in machine learning sparked from taking my college courses Data Mining and Deep Learning. These courses contained similar content as Stanford's CS229 and CS231n, respectively. The content included but was not limited to: gradient descent (vanilla, mini-batch), linear classifier, softmax classifier, SVM classifier, Bernoulli distribution, decision tree classification, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks (LSTM), data pre-processing techniques, hyperparameter optimization, regularization. I also made a blog post explaining the various activation functions used in neural networks [10].  

Apart from machine learning, I am also quite enthusiastic about image process. My final year project involves creating a structure from motion pipeline using a monocular camera [11]. To learn all the intricate step involved in this, we followed the Robotics: Perception course on Coursera. I have implemented numerous image processing filters (Gaussian, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian), edge detectors (Canny, Marr Hildreth), morphological operators (Convex hulling, Erosion, Dilation), object detectors (Generalized Hough transform, simple convolution), and seam carvers. These were implemented from scratch making use of  the ``NumPy`` Python library [12], [13].
